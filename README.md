1.In order to get started with the frontend project we need some tools. One of them is Node.js/NPM. Head on over to this website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ The LTS option will be highlighted as of writing this guide. Choose the <i>"Windows Installer"</i> option and a download will be prompted. The downloaded file will also include the NPM Package manager.

2.Open the downloaded file and your system will ask you if you want to run the software. Click _"Run"_.  The installation wizard will start. 
In order to proceed, click _"Next"_ until the option to click _"Install"_ is being presented. Just click install and the installation will proceed. When it is 
done, click "Finish" to close the installation wizard.a
  
3.Check if Node.js / NPM is installed by opening a command prompt on the system and running these seperate commands: 
 </br> `node -v`</br> `npm -v`</br> If both are installed correctly they will output their respective version.
