## What is the purpose of Plex
During their studies FHICT students will work on multiple group projects. The semester owner needs to select a number of projects and share them with his students. The students will then be able to see the details of the projects the semester owner selected for them. The students will then be able to submit their preference of the available projects. The semester owner can then use the students preferences to divide the students into groups. 

A tool for teachers to appoint students to their preferred projects. The goal of this application is to enhance and amplify the efficiency of this process for the teacher as well as the student.  

### Dex intergration
Plex will be using the project information from the <a href="https://dex.software/home">DEX-platform</a> another fontys designed platform. For more information about DEX checkout their <a href="https://github.com/DigitalExcellence/dex-backend/wiki/General-Description">wiki</a>.

### Centralize
The information on the projects the students could choose from tended to be scattered over multiple seperate documents or had to be combined into one document by the semester owner. Plex will centralize all the relevant info in one easy accesible location.

### Automatic group creation
Students will be able to use Plex to submit their project preferences. The Plex-platform will be able to provide the semester owner with a group composition suggestion based on the provided preferences. This will be done via a sorting algorithm. The teacher can then edit these groups to their own discretion before saving them to the school's system.
